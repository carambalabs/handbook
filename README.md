## :bento: Products

Caramba offers to the world 3 different kind of products: Full App Experiences, App Design and App Development. In the branches of App Design and App Development there are a lot of sub-products.

### Full Apps

Full App experiences are products that start from just and idea or briefing and end up beeing amazing digital products shipped in a Store.

### App Development

We consider these the most important areas in App Development. We share our knowledge with our client to make their products better.

##### Consulting

We love what we do and for that reason we love to talk, debate and discuss about anything related with Apps. (TBD)

##### Arquitecture

Any App end up being a complex piece of software with millions of lines of code. How all these lines of code are organized and structured is really important for the future of the App and the health of the engineers. We love to design architectures fully adapted to specific Apps.

##### Integrations

Integrations are important, there are tones of great services out there that can be used to power up an App. Integrate Facebook to share workout activities, integrate Fabric to report crashes and usage metrics, integrate BuddyBuild to distribute a beta or receive feedback, integrate AppBoy to launch in-app marketing campaigns, integrate Zendesk to provide in-app support. The possibilities are infinite and we can help a client to integrate them.

##### Automation

Process automation saves a lot of time and we love to **automate all the things**!
Almost everything can be automated through scripts. Process like deploy and distribute a Beta, publish a new version in the Store, check that a Pull Request doesn't break anything. There is tones of things that can be automated and we love to automate them all!

##### Sharing Knowledge

Experiences and knowledge must be shared, it's the only way to grow. We love to share what we've learnt so far. We can organize talks or workshops designed for the client needs.

## :mailbox: Communication

### Internal Communication

1. All written communication happens preferably in English, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
2. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible (issues and email instead of chat), issues are preferred over email and email is preferred over chat. People should not be interrupted by chat unless it's completly necessary.
3. Direct your communication to your target and avoid make unnecessary noise to others.
4. If any decision is taken in chat or offline make sure those decisions are reflected in the corresponding issue.

### Chat

We use Slack for chat communications, the url is `carambastudio.slack.com`. These are the channels we use:

### Video Chats

We use [appear.in](http://appear.in) for video call communications. We have a blocked room: [appear.in/caramba](http://appear.in/caramba)

1. Make sure you have an appear.in account and you are invited as member of caramba room.
2. Install appear.in chrome extensions to get push notifications and be able to share the screen.

## :microphone: Meetings

2. The schedule of this meeting is: UTC+1 TBD - TBD Monday
2. Make sure you add anything you want to address in the weekly meeting to this document: WIP

## Workflow

[WIP]

### Pair programming

When any coding work needs help from two or more people we should encourage pair programming on the task. With more than one person working on the same issue, the quality of the work is higher and it's easier to identify issues in the implementation. Try to pair with someone that has more context on the issue that you are currently working on.

If you are in remote, there's a tool, [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) that makes it possible. If you don't have account, ask to anyone in the team for one. With the tool you can share one's screen, and both control the keyboard and the mouse.

## Tools and Tips

[WIP] Investigate or explain:
Calendly, Shush, Disabling OS X Notification Center, Zoom, Email Signature,
Appear.in, One Tab, Quitter, Trip Mode
